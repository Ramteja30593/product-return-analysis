# Product Return Analysis 📦

A data analysis mini-project using Python, Excel, and machine learning to explore product returns by category and region.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Excel (Formulas, Pivot Tables, Charts)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Analysis Performed

- Return percentage by Category & Region
- Most returned products
- Correlation between Price, Quantity, and Returns
- Return prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📁 Files

- `return_analysis_report.xlsx`: Cleaned dataset with calculated fields
- `return_analysis.ipynb`: Code notebook for cleaning, analysis & modeling
- `charts/`: Saved graphs and visualizations

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `return_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Run all cells to see the analysis
4. View results in the Excel report or generated plots
